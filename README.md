An online video game retail store, where users can buy, download, and add games they want to a wishlist. 
Users can also set an alert on the Wishlist for a price range they are interested in, if the game’s price hit that range, they will be sent an email to let them know e.g. the price range is 20 – 30 euros. 
When the user buys a game, the game will be added to their game library, an order will be made, and they will be sent a confirmation email. 
They could download the game however this is only a simulation of a download using JavaScript and a text file as it was a last-minute addition I added, in a real application the game files would also be stored in the database and would be downloaded from there.
